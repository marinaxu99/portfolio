        <div class="intro">
            <p>I work at the intersection of film and media.
            <p>With experience in
                various productions, including narrative, documentary, and live
                sports, I’ve realized that creating great content is only half the battle
                —understanding how to market and distribute it is just as important.</p>
            <p>I’m currently studying how to bridge media science with art, learning
                strategies to better connect stories with audiences.</p>
